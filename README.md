## Installation

This application requires [rwkv-flask](https://github.com/iacore/rwkv-flask) running in the background.

## TODO

- better font loader
- cache state/probs
    facet by `n_vocab`, `n_state`, `seen_tokens`, also `model_path` as caution


- force infer single token (node)

- cache last 16 states
    - resume from them

- use consistent wording
- write readme
- scroll wheel scroll canvas
- dynamic canvas background


good to have
- faster sampler
